# KCBS Barbeque Competition Analytics

This project explores KCBS competition data from 2013-2016. I used Python (selenium, beautiful soup) to pull the data from the KCBS website. Data analysis will include choropleths (colored maps) based on competition meta-data, and state-by-state score data comparisons.

## Choropleths

The visuals folder contains choropleths on three measures in the data. These maps were made with Tableau. They include;

* competitions per state (red)
* total prize dollars per state (green)
* average prize dollars per (prized) competition (gold)

## Scoring

In Progress. Comparisons between category score distributions across states are made difficult by the relative (and partially subjective) scoring process.

Competition Data: http://www.kcbs.us/events.

The date range was chosen to include dates after the latest scoring standard went into effect on July 2013.
