**KCBS Barbeque Competition Analytics**

This project gathers KCBS Barbeque competition data from 2013-2016 in Python. Competition data was parsed from the HTML of the KCBS website. The main libraries used in this project are Python's Requests, BeautifulSoup4 and Pandas.

**WIP**
The next step in this project is analysis of regional scoring trends at the state level. I intend to produce geographic visualizations of scoring data, and answer questions about which states perform most strongly by various metrics. Additional questions for analysis may come up over the course of the project. I have directly requested data from KCBS (individual judge data, accurate team data etc), but I have not received a response to date.

Competition Data: http://www.kcbs.us/events.

The date range was chosen to include dates after the latest scoring standard went into effect on July 2013.
